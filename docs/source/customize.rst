Customizing Voilà
=================

There are many ways you can customize Voilà to control the look and feel
of the dashboards you create.

Changing the theme
==================

By default, Voilà uses the **light** theme, but you can set the theme to **dark** by passing
the following option:

.. code-block:: bash

   voila <path-to-notebook> --theme=dark

Or by passing in the query parameter ``voila-theme``, e.g. a URL like ``http://localhost:8867/voila/render/query-strings.ipynb?voila-theme=dark``.

The theme can also be set in the notebook metadata, under ``metadata/voila/theme`` by editing the notebook file manually, or using the metadata editor in for instance the classical notebook

.. image:: metadata-theme-classic.png
   :alt: Edit metadata

System administrators who want to disable changing the theme, can pass ``--VoilaConfiguration.allow_theme_override=NO`` or
``--VoilaConfiguration.allow_theme_override=NOTEBOOK`` to disable changing the theme completely, or only allow it from the notebook metadata.

Like nbconvert, Voilà supports the **light** and **dark** themes by default, but you can also use custom JupyterLab themes:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install jupyterlab_miami_nights
   voila <path-to-notebook> --theme=jupyterlab_miami_nights

.. warning::
   Theme are specific to the "lab" template, they will not work for the "classic" template

.. note::
   Changing the theme from the notebook metadata may change in the future if this features moves to nbconvert.

Controlling the nbconvert template
==================================

Voilà uses **nbconvert** to convert your Jupyter Notebook into an HTML dashboard.
nbconvert has a rich templating system that allows you to customize the way in
which your Jupyter Notebook is converted into HTML.

By default, Voilà will render the HTML from your notebook in the same linear fashion
that the notebook follows. If you'd like to use a different layout, this can be
controlled by creating a new nbconvert template, registering it with Voilà,
and calling it from the command-line like so:

.. code-block:: bash

   voila <path-to-notebook> --template=<name-of-template>

For example, Voilà includes one other template that uses a Javascript library and
an alternate ``<div>`` layout in order to let the user drag and drop cells.

For example, to use the `gridstack <https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila-gridstack/>`_ template, use the command:

.. code-block:: bash

   voila <path-to-notebook> --template=gridstack


Or by passing in the query parameter ``voila-template``, e.g. a URL like ``http://localhost:8867/voila/render/query-strings.ipynb?voila-template=material`` (Note that this requires installing voila-material).

The template can also set in the notebook metadata, under ``metadata/voila/template`` by editing the notebook file manually, or using the metadata editor in for instance the classical notebook

.. image:: metadata-template-classic.png
   :alt: Edit metadata

System administrators who want to disable changing the theme, can pass ``--VoilaConfiguration.allow_template_override=NO` or
``--VoilaConfiguration.allow_template_override=NOTEBOOK`` to disable changing the theme completely, or only allow it from the notebook metadata.

.. note::
   Changing the template from the notebook metadata may change in the future if this features moves to nbconvert.

.. warning::
   The "classic" template is being deprecated and its support will be removed in Voilà 1.0.0, an alternative is to use ``voila --template lab --show-margins`` to get a similar look.


Creating your own template
==========================

You can create your own nbconvert template for use with Voilà. This allows you
to control the look and feel of your dashboard.

In order to create your own template, first familiarize yourself with **Jinja**,
**HTML**, and **CSS**. Each of these is used in creating custom templates.
For more information, see
`the nbconvert templates documentation <https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/customizing.html#Custom-Templates>`_.
For one example, `check out the nbconvert basic HTML template <https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/blob/master/share/jupyter/nbconvert/templates/classic/base.html.j2>`_.

A few example voila/nbconvert template projects are:

* https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila-gridstack
* https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila-material
* https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila-vuetify


Where are Voilà templates located?
----------------------------------

All Voilà templates are stored as folders with particular configuration/template files inside.
These folders can exist in the standard Jupyter configuration locations, in a folder called ``voila/templates``.
For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   ~/.local/share/jupyter/voila/templates
   ~/path/to/env/dev/share/jupyter/voila/templates
   /usr/local/share/jupyter/voila/templates
   /usr/share/jupyter/voila/templates

Voilà will search these locations for a folder, one per template, where
the folder name defines the template name.

The Voilà template structure
----------------------------

Within each template folder, you can provide your own nbconvert templates, static
files, and HTML templates (for pages such as a 404 error). For example, here is
the folder structure of the base Voilà template (called "default"):

.. code-block:: bash

    tree path/to/env/share/jupyter/voila/templates/default/
    ├── nbconvert_templates
    │   ├── base.tpl
    │   └── voila.tpl
    └── templates
        ├── 404.html
        ├── error.html
        ├── page.html
        └── tree.html

**To customize the nbconvert template**, store it in a folder called ``templatename/nbconvert_templates/voila.tpl``.
In the case of the default template, we also provide a ``base.tpl`` that our custom template uses as a base.
The name ``voila.tpl`` is special - you cannot name your custom nbconvert something else.

**To customize the HTML page templates**, store them in a folder called ``templatename/templates/<name>.html``.
These are files that Voilà can serve as standalone HTML (for example, the ``tree.html`` template defines how
folders/files are displayed in ``localhost:8866/voila/tree``). You can override the defaults by providing your
own HTML files of the same name.

**To configure your Voilà template**, you should add a ``config.json`` file to the root of your template
folder.

.. todo: Add information on config.json


An example custom template
--------------------------

To show how to create your own custom template, let's create our own nbconvert template.
We'll have two goals:

1. Add an ``<h1>`` header displaying "Our awesome template" to the Voilà dashboard.
2. Add a custom 404.html page that displays an image.

First, we'll create a folder in ``~/.local/share/jupyter/voila/templates`` called ``mytemplate``::

    mkdir ~/.local/share/jupyter/voila/templates/mytemplate
    cd ~/.local/share/jupyter/voila/templates/mytemplate

Next, we'll copy over the base template files for Voilà, which we'll modify::

    cp -r path/to/env/share/jupyter/voila/templates/default/nbconvert_templates ./
    cp -r path/to/env/share/jupyter/voila/templates/default/templates ./

We should now have a folder structure like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    tree .
    ├── nbconvert_templates
    │   ├── base.tpl
    │   └── voila.tpl
    └── templates
        ├── 404.html
        ├── error.html
        ├── page.html
        └── tree.html

Now, we'll edit ``nbconvert_templates/voila.tpl`` to include a custom H1 header.

As well as ``templates/tree.html`` to include an image.

Finally, we can tell Voilà to use this custom template the next time we use it on
a Jupyter notebook by using the name of the folder in the ``--template`` parameter::

    voila mynotebook.ipynb --template=mytemplate


The result should be a Voilà dashboard with your custom modifications made!

Voilà template cookiecutter
-----------------------------

There is a Voilà template cookiecutter available to give you a running start.
This cookiecutter contains some docker configuration for live reloading of your template changes to make development easier.
Please refer to the `cookiecutter repo <https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila-template-cookiecutter>`_ for more information on how to use the Voilà template cookiecutter.

Accessing the tornado request (`prelaunch-hook`)
---------------------------------------------------

In certain custom setups when you need to access the tornado request object in order to check for authentication cookies, access details about the request headers, or modify the notebook before rendering. You can leverage the `prelaunch-hook`, which lets you inject a function to inspect the notebook and the request prior to executing them.

.. warning::
   Because `prelaunch-hook` only runs after receiving a new request but before the notebook is executed, it is incompatible with
   `preheated kernels`.

Creating a hook function
**************************
The format of this hook should be:

.. code-block:: python

   def hook(req: tornado.web.RequestHandler,
            notebook: nbformat.NotebookNode,
            cwd: str) -> Optional[nbformat.NotebookNode]:

- The first argument will be a reference to the tornado `RequetHandler`, with which you can inspect parameters, headers, etc.
- The second argument will be the `NotebookNode`, which you can mutate to e.g. inject cells or make other notebook-level modifications.
- The last argument is the current working directory should you need to mutate anything on disk.
- The return value of your hook function can either be `None`, or a `NotebookNode`.

Adding the hook function to Voilà
***********************************
There are two ways to add the hook function to Voila:

- Using the `voila.py` configuration file:

Here is an example of the configuration file. This file needs to be placed in the directory where you start Voilà.

.. code-block:: python

   def hook_function(req, notebook, cwd):
      """Do your stuffs here"""
      return notebook

   c.Voila.prelaunch_hook = hook_function

- Start Voila from a python script:

Here is an example of a custom `prelaunch-hook` to execute a notebook with `papermill`:

.. code-block:: python

    def parameterize_with_papermill(req, notebook, cwd):
        import tornado

        # Grab parameters
        parameters = req.get_argument("parameters", {})

        # try to convert to dict if not e.g. string/unicode
        if not isinstance(parameters, dict):
            try:
                parameters = tornado.escape.json_decode(parameters)
            except ValueError:
                parameters = None

        # if passed and a dict, use papermill to inject parameters
        if parameters and isinstance(parameters, dict):
            from papermill.parameterize import parameterize_notebook

            # setup for papermill
            #
            # these two blocks are done
            # to avoid triggering errors
            # in papermill's notebook
            # loading logic
            for cell in notebook.cells:
                if 'tags' not in cell.metadata:
                    cell.metadata.tags = []
                if "papermill" not in notebook.metadata:
                    notebook.metadata.papermill = {}

            # Parameterize with papermill
            return parameterize_notebook(notebook, parameters)

To add this hook to your `Voilà` application:

.. code-block:: python

    from voila.app import Voila
    from voila.config import VoilaConfiguration

    # customize config how you like
    config = VoilaConfiguration()

    # create a voila instance
    app = Voila()

    # set the config
    app.voila_configuration = config

    # set the prelaunch hook
    app.prelaunch_hook = parameterize_with_papermill

    # launch
    app.start()


Adding your own static files
============================

If you create your own theme, you may also want to define and use your
own static files, such as CSS and Javascript. To use your own static files,
follow these steps:

1. Create a folder along with your template (e.g., ``mytemplate/static/``).
2. Put your static files in this template.
3. In your template file (e.g. ``voila.tpl``), link these static files with
   the following path::

      {{resources.base_url}}voila/static/<path-to-static-files>

4. When you call ``voila``, configure the static folder by using the
   ``--static`` kwarg, or by configuring ``--VoilaConfiguration.static_root``.

Any folders / files that are inside the folder given with this configuration
will be copied to ``{{resources.base_url}}voila/static/``.

For example, if you had a CSS file called ``custom.css`` in ``static/css``,
you would link it in your template like so::

   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{{resources.base_url}}voila/static/css/custom.css"></link>


Configure Voilà for the Jupyter Server
======================================

Several pieces of ``voila``'s functionality can be controlled when it is
run. This can be done either as a part of the standalone CLI, or with the
Jupyter Server. To configure ``voila`` when run by the Jupyter Server,
use the following pattern when invoking the command that runs Jupyter (e.g.,
Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook)::

   <jupyter-command> --VoilaConfiguration.<config-key>=<config-value>

For example, to control the template used by ``voila`` from within a Jupyter
Lab session, use the following command when starting the server::

   jupyter lab --VoilaConfiguration.template=distill

When users run ``voila`` by hitting the ``voila/`` endpoint, this configuration
will be used.

Serving static files
====================

Unlike JupyterLab or the classic notebook server, ``voila`` does not serve
all files that are present in the directory of the notebook. Only files that
match one of the whitelists and none of the blacklist regular expression are
served by Voilà::

    voila mydir --VoilaConfiguration.file_whitelist="['.*']" \
      --VoilaConfiguration.file_blacklist="['private.*', '.*\.(ipynb)']"

Which will serve all files, except anything starting with private, or notebook files::

   voila mydir --VoilaConfiguration.file_whitelist="['.*\.(png|jpg|gif|svg|mp4|avi|ogg)']"

Will serve many media files, and also never serve notebook files (which is the default blacklist).

Run scripts
===========

Voilà can run text (or script) files, by configuring how a file extension maps to a kernel language::

   voila mydir --VoilaConfiguration.extension_language_mapping='{".py": "python", ".jl": "julia"}'

Voilà will find a kernel that matches the language specified, but can also be
configured to use a specific kernel for each language::

   voila mydir --VoilaConfiguration.extension_language_mapping='{".py": "python", ".jl": "julia"}'\
     --VoilaConfiguration.language_kernel_mapping='{"python": "xpython"}'

In this case it will use the `xeus-python
<https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus-python/>`_. kernel to run `.py` files.

Note that the script will be executed as notebook with a single cell, meaning
that only the last expression will be printed as output. Use the Jupyter
display mechanism to output any text or rich output such as Jupyter widgets. For
Python this would be a call to `IPython.display.display`.

Using `Jupytext <https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext>`_ is another way to support
script files. After installing jupytext, Voilà will see script files as if they
are notebooks, and requires no extra configuration.

Cull idle kernels
=================

Voilà starts a new Jupyter kernel every time a notebook is rendered to the user. In some situations, this can lead to a higher memory consumption.

The Jupyter Server exposes several options that can be used to terminate kernels that are not active anymore. They can be configured using the Voilà standalone app:

.. code-block:: bash

   voila --MappingKernelManager.cull_interval=60 --MappingKernelManager.cull_idle_timeout=120

The server will periodically check for idle kernels, in this example every 60 seconds, and cull them if they have been idle for more than 120 seconds.

The same parameters apply when using Voilà as a server extension:

.. code-block:: bash

    jupyter notebook --MappingKernelManager.cull_interval=60 --MappingKernelManager.cull_idle_timeout=120

There is also the ``MappingKernelManager.cull_busy`` and ``MappingKernelManager.cull_connected`` options to cull busy kernels and kernels with an active connection.

For more information about these options, check out the `Jupyter Server <https://jupyter-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/other/full-config.html#options>`_ documentation.

Preheated kernels
==================

Since Voilà needs to start a new jupyter kernel and execute the requested notebook in this kernel for every connection, this would lead to a long waiting time before the widgets can be displayed in the browser.
To reduce this waiting time, especially for heavy notebooks, users can activate the preheating kernel option of Voilà.

.. warning::
   Because preheated kernels are not executed on request, this feature is incompatible with the `prelaunch-hook` functionality.

This option will enable two features:


- A pool of kernels is started for each notebook and kept in standby, then the notebook is executed in every kernel of its pool. When a new client requests a kernel, the preheated kernel in this pool is used and another kernel is started asynchronously to refill the pool.
- The HTML version of the notebook is rendered in each preheated kernel and stored, when a client connects to Voila, under some conditions, the cached HTML is served instead of re-rendering the notebook.

The preheating kernel option works with any kernel manager, it is deactivated by default, re-activate it by setting `preheat_kernel = True`.  For example, with this command, for each notebook Voilà started with, a pool of 5 kernels is created and will be used for new connections.

.. code-block:: bash

    voila --preheat_kernel=True --pool_size=5

The default environment variables for preheated kernels can be set by the `VoilaKernelManager.default_env_variables` setting. For example, this command

.. code-block:: bash

    voila --preheat_kernel=True --VoilaKernelManager.default_env_variables='{"FOO": "BAR"}'

will set the variable "FOO" in all preheated kernels.

If the pool size does not match the user's requirements, or some notebooks need to use specific environment variables..., additional settings are needed.  The easiest way to change these settings is to provide a file named `voila.json` in the same folder containing the notebooks. Settings for preheating kernel ( list of notebooks does not need preheated kernels, number of kernels in pool, refilling delay, environment variables for starting kernel...) can be set under the `VoilaKernelManager` class name.

Here is an example of settings with explanations for preheating kernel option.

.. code-block:: python

   # voila.json
   {
      "VoilaConfiguration": {
         # Activate or deactivate preheat kernel option.
         "preheat_kernel": true
      },
      "VoilaKernelManager": {
         # A list of notebook name or regex patterns to exclude notebooks from using preheat kernel.
         "preheat_blacklist": [
            "notebook-does-not-need-preheat.ipynb",
            "^.*foo.*$",
            ...
         ],
         # Configuration for kernel pools
         "kernel_pools_config": {
            # Setting for `voila.ipynb` notebook
            "voila.ipynb": {
               "pool_size": 3, # Size of pool
               "kernel_env_variables": { # The environment variables used to start kernel for `voila.ipynb`
                  "foo2": "bar2"
               }
            },
            # Setting for `test/sub-voila.ipynb` notebook
            "test/sub-voila.ipynb": {
               "pool_size": 1
            },
            ...
            # If a notebook does not have setting, it will use default setting
            "default": {
               "pool_size": 2,
               "kernel_env_variables": {
                  "foo": "bar"
               }
            },
         },
         # Delay time in second before filling the kernel pool.
         "fill_delay": 0
      }
   }

Notebook HTML will be pre-rendered with template and theme defined in VoilaConfiguration or notebook metadata. The preheated kernel and cached HTML are used if these conditions are matched:

- There is an available preheated kernel in the kernel pool.
- If user overrides the template/theme with query string, it must match the template/theme used to pre-render the notebook.

If the kernel pool is empty or the request does not match these conditions, Voila will fail back to start a normal kernel and render the notebook as usual.

Partially pre-render notebook
------------------------------

To benefit the acceleration of preheating kernel mode, the notebooks need to be pre-rendered before users actually connect to Voilà. But in many real-world cases, the notebook requires some user-specific data to render correctly the widgets, which makes pre-rendering impossible. To overcome this limit, Voilà offers a feature to treat the most used method for providing user data: the URL `query string`.

.. note::
   For more advanced interaction with the tornado request object, see the `prelaunch-hook` feature.

In normal mode, Voilà users can get the `query string` at run time through the ``QUERY_STRING`` environment variable:

.. code-block:: python

   import os
   query_string = os.getenv('QUERY_STRING')

In preheating kernel mode, users can prepend with ``wait_for_request`` from ``voila.utils``

.. code-block:: python

   import os
   from voila.utils import wait_for_request
   wait_for_request()
   query_string = os.getenv('QUERY_STRING')

``wait_for_request`` will pause the execution of the notebook in the preheated kernel at this cell and wait for an actual user to connect to Voilà, set the request info environment variables and then continue the execution of the remaining cells.

If the Voilà websocket handler is not started with the default protocol (`ws`), the default IP address (`127.0.0.1`) the default port (`8866`) or with url suffix, users need to provide these values through the environment variables ``VOILA_WS_PROTOCOL``, ``VOILA_APP_IP``, ``VOILA_APP_PORT`` and ``VOILA_WS_BASE_URL``. One way to set these variables is in the `voila.json` configuration file, for example:

.. code-block:: python

   # voila.json
   {
      ...
      "VoilaKernelManager": {
         "kernel_pools_config": {
            "foo.ipynb": {
               "kernel_env_variables": {
                  "VOILA_APP_IP": "192.168.1.1",
                  "VOILA_APP_PORT": "6789",
                  "VOILA_WS_PROTOCOL": "wss"
               }
            }
         },
      ...
      }
   }

Additionally, you can set these with the command:

.. code-block:: bash

    voila --preheat_kernel=True --VoilaKernelManager.default_env_variables='{"VOILA_WS_PROTOCOL":"wss","VOILA_APP_IP":"192.168.1.1"}'

Hiding output and code cells based on cell tags
===============================================

Voilà uses `nbconvert <https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert>`_ under the hood to render the notebooks so we can benefit from some of its advanced functionalities to hide code and output cells based on cell tags.

To hide the cell output for every cell in your notebook that has been tagged (`how to tag <https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#cell-tags>`_) with "hide" in Voilà::

    voila --TagRemovePreprocessor.remove_all_outputs_tags='{"hide"}' your_notebook.ipynb

To hide both the code cell and the output cell (if any) for every cell that has been tagged with "hide"::

    voila --TagRemovePreprocessor.remove_cell_tags='{"hide"}' your_notebook.ipynb

You can use any tag you want but be sure to use the same tag name in the Voilà command.
And please note that this functionality will only hide the cells in Voilà but will not prevent them from being executed.

Cell execution timeouts
=======================

By default, Voilà does not have an execution timeout, meaning there is no limit for how long it takes for Voilà to execute and render your notebook.  If you have potentially long-running cells, you may wish to set a cell execution timeout so that users of your dashboard will get an error if it takes longer than expected to execute the notebook.  For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    voila --VoilaExecutor.timeout=30 your_notebook.ipynb

With this setting, if any cell takes longer than 30 seconds to run, a ``TimeoutError`` will be raised.  You can further customize this behavior using the ``VoilaExecutor.timeout_func`` and ``VoilaExecutor.interrupt_on_timeout`` options.
